Description : 
1) quadratic_solver_stationary.m : driver file
2) mesh5_gmsh.m : Reads a P2-P1 gmsh mesh as specified in testcase
   mesh5_gmsh_1.m: Reads a P1-P1 gmsh mesh as specified in testcase
3) main_stationary_picard.m: Runs the iteration loop
4) build_stiffness_operator_stationary: Builds stiffness matrix for P2-P1 case
5) build_stiffness_operator_stationaryP1: Builds stiffness matrix for P1-P1 case
6) testcase.m: builds the testcase (mesh files can be chosen here. Physical gmsh tags for inlet, walls and do nothing are readily prescribed here)
7) update_bc, globalrow, global pressure row: some helpers used in updating boundary conditions in iteration 
8) precomputeShapeFunctionsP1/P2: shape function libraries for precomputing shapes at gauss points
9) writePVD/VTP: files for writing output to paraview
10) quada/b/c/d...p2/p1  : various ready gmsh files in P2-P1 pairs use as per letter tags together. eg: use quadap1 along with quadap2 only(not with quadbp2 for example since quadbp2 only goes with quadbp1)
